        Nature
        </strong>is an inherent character or constitution, particularly of the <em>ecosphere</em> or the <em>universe</em> as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright <em>separate and even superior</em> to nature.</p>
    <p>During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws. With the <em>Industrial Revolution</em>, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). <strong>However, a vitalist vision of nature</strong>, closer to the pre-Socratic one, got reborn at the same time, especially after Charles Darwin.</p>

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The word <em>nature is borrowed</em> from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or <em> "essential qualities, innate disposition"</em>, and in ancient times, literally meant "birth". In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world to develop of their own accord. The concept of nature as a whole, <strong>the physical universe</strong>, is one of several expansions of the original notion;[2] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily gained currency ever since.</p>

    <h3>Earth</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the <em>Solar System</em>, it is third closest to the Sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region. Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. <strong>71</strong> percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with <em>most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemispare.</em>
    </p>
    <p>Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The <em>interior remains active</em>, with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, <em>generate the geomagnetic field.</em>

    <h4>Geology</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <strong>Geology</strong> is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the Earth. The <em>field of geology encompasses</em> the study of the composition, structure, physical properties, dynamics, and history of Earth materials, and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major academic discipline, and is also important for mineral and <em>hydrocarbon extraction</em>, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.</p>

    <h5>Geological evolution</h5>
    <hr>
    <p>The <em>geology of an area evolves through time as rock units</em> are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.</p>
    <p>
    Rock units are <em>first emplaced either by deposition</em> onto the surface or intrude into the overlying rock. Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later <strong>lithify</strong> into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface. Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.
